# -Patient-Encounter-Cost-and-Risk-Analysis-in-Healthcare-Systems

1. Patient Encounter Cost and Risk Analysis in Healthcare Systems.

   This project focuses on analyzing healthcare cost data to uncover key insights related to encounter types, patient utilization, procedure trends, payer coverage gaps, and regional cost disparities. The dashboard     provides a comprehensive, data-driven view to support strategic healthcare planning and resource optimization.

2. Key business question.

   Which encounter types contribute most to overall healthcare costs?

   Who are the high-utilization patients, and what is driving their costs?

   Which portions of care are not covered by payers, and what are the common denial reasons?

   How do procedure costs change over time, and are there any cost spikes or inefficiencies?

   Which regions incur the highest healthcare expenses, and what patterns can be observed geographically?

3. Dataset.

   Encounters.csv,

   Patients.csv,

   Payers.csv,

   Organizations.csv,

   Procedures.csv .

6. Tools requuired.

    SQL Server Management Studio - Main data cleaning or the sql querry structure are made on the server studio . 

    Power BI Desktop -  Main Data Visualization platform is used for report creation.

    Power Querry - Data transformation  and cleaning layer for reshaping for reshaping and preparing the data.

    DAX (Data Analysis Expression)  - Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

    Data Modeling - Releationship established among tables (encounters,  organizations, patients, payers, procedures) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation

    File Format - .pbix for development and .png for dassboard previews.

   
   
8. Business Impacts and Insights.


    1. Encounter Cost Distribution
       
       Insight:
       
       Breaks down healthcare costs by EncounterClass (e.g..).

       Business Impact:

       Identifies which types of encounters drive the highest costs.

       Helps healthcare administrators optimize budgeting and staffing based on service demand.

       Supports cost-reduction strategies in high-expense care settings (e.g., ).

   2. High-Cost Patient Identification
      
      Insight:
      
      Highlights patients with frequent or expensive healthcare encounters (e.g., more than 3 visits/year costing over $10,000).

      Business Impact:

      Enables early intervention and case management for high-risk patients.

      Reduces preventable hospital visits through targeted chronic care programs.

      Improves patient outcomes while lowering long-term costs.

   4. Uncovered Costs Analysis
      
      Insight:

      Examines gaps between total claim cost and payer contributions, categorized by PayerType and ReasonCode.

      Business Impact:

      Reveals systemic issues in insurance coverage or billing processes.

      Helps reduce revenue loss by addressing frequent denial reasons.

      Supports negotiations with insurers by providing denial trends and justification data.

 4. Procedure Cost Trends
    
    Insight:
    
    Shows how procedure-related costs vary over time (monthly/annually), helping to spot patterns or cost inflation.

    Business Impact:

    Supports evaluation of cost-effectiveness for procedures and treatments.

    Helps in detecting overuse, underuse, or cost spikes in specific services.

    Informs procurement and pricing decisions for medical technologies or supplies.

5. Geographical Analysis
   
   Insight:
   
   Identifies regions or locations with disproportionately high healthcare costs.

   Business Impact:

   Assists in targeting regional health programs or outreach efforts.

   Informs decisions on resource allocation, staffing, or facility placement.

   Helps public health agencies prioritize areas for cost control or health education.
