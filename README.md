1. Patient Encounter Cost and Risk Analysis in Healthcare Systems.

   This project focuses on analyzing healthcare cost data to uncover key insights related to encounter types, patient utilization, procedure trends, payer coverage gaps, and regional cost disparities. The dashboard     provides a comprehensive, data-driven view to support strategic healthcare planning and resource optimization.

2. Key business question.

   Which encounter types contribute most to overall healthcare costs?

   Who are the high-utilization patients, and what is driving their costs?

   Which portions of care are not covered by payers, and what are the common denial reasons?

   How do procedure costs change over time, and are there any cost spikes or inefficiencies?

   Which regions incur the highest healthcare expenses, and what patterns can be observed geographically?
